Pathfinding is a program that visualizes pathfinding.

# Example
![](images/example.png)

Supports pathfinding such as:
* BFS
* DFS
* A\* algorithm(In the future)

# Control
Mouse:
* LBM - Paint the cell black
* RBM - Paint the cell white

Keyboard:
* F-Find the path
* G-Generate maze
* S-Set the starting point of the path
* E-Put the end point of the path
* C-Clear the entire field
* X-Fill in the entire field in black


# TODO
* Add more pathfinding algorithms
* Add the ability to create mazes
